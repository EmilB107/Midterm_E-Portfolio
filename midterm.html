				<h1 class="text-center mb-3">Midterm</h1>
				<p>This page contains most of what we've done during this semester midterm, including activities and projects.</p>
				<p>Throughout the midterm, I had the chance to go back over many of the ideas I once learned from online resources—even some that I had almost forgotten. This midterm wasn't just about repeating old knowledge; it was a chance to rediscover what I knew and to learn new things that I hadn't even realized existed.</p>
				<p>A big area of growth for me was in working with vanilla CSS. Early in my web development journey, I relied mostly on frameworks and skipped over the basics of CSS. During the midterm, I revisited core CSS topics like the box model, specificity rules, and layout techniques with flexbox and grid. Each assignment pushed me to work directly with CSS, and this helped me understand how different styles work together to create attractive and responsive designs.</p>
				<p>The midterm challenges really forced me out of my comfort zone. They showed me how important it is to have a strong grasp of the basics. Every task served as a step toward improving my overall understanding of web design and development. By returning to what I had learned before and trying out new techniques, I was able to turn my weak areas into strengths—or at least improve it into comfort.</p>

				<h2 class="text-center mb-3">About Me</h2>
				<p>This activity is a written self-introduction, where I had to introduce who I am, my character, and things I wanna learn more about this semester in this course.</p>

				<h2 class="text-center mb-3">Assignment #1</h2>
				<p>This activity is another written task, which involved researching and defining various terms related to web development. Although the task was relatively simple, it turned out to be quite tedious since it had to be hand-written. In the process, I explored a range of essential topics—from best practices like writing lean, modular code and ensuring security and accessibility, to emerging trends such as Progressive Web Apps, WebAssembly, and serverless architecture that are reshaping the industry. I also examined the role of backend development in handling server-side logic and data storage, and compared different server-side technologies like Node.js, PHP, and Django in terms of performance and ease of use. Additionally, I reviewed the fundamentals of HTML and the importance of semantic markup for improving both accessibility and search engine optimization.</p>

				<h2 class="text-center mb-3">Quiz #1</h2>
				<p>This was a surprise quiz that we hadn't prepared for beforehand. Honestly, I was quite relaxed about it, expecting questions on the basics, but it ended up being much more challenging. There were questions about tags—ones I had never even heard of—that required me to identify them. Since the quiz is now closed and I can't review my mistakes, I haven't been able to go over the questions I got wrong. However, this experience made me realize the importance of at least memorizing the names of commonly used HTML tags and elements instead of relying solely on search engines or AI to help me use them effectively.</p>

				<h2 class="text-center mb-3">Activity #1</h2>
				<p>This was our first hands-on activity in HTML. The task was quite simple: to create three static HTML files showcasing events commonly celebrated in the Philippines. I chose the EDSA Revolution, Independence Day, and National Heroes Day. Aside from serving as a refresher on HTML, this activity also made me feel a bit more patriotic—or at least more aware of the significance of these events for our country, especially as a Filipino citizen.</p>

				<p>This activity involved creating a website using only HTML to help us become more familiar with various HTML tags, especially form elements. The main focus was on using the &lt;table&gt; tag to display three different dishes in a structured layout. Each dish was presented in its own column, featuring a list of ingredients, the cooking procedure, and an image of the dish.</p>

				<h2 class="text-center mb-3">Activity #5</h2>
				<p>This activity was the most fun and challenging task we've done so far—aside from the midterm project, in my opinion. I found it difficult mainly because we had to come up with or imagine an event, which isn't exactly my strength. The fact that we had to use vanilla CSS was a smaller concern. To get started, I looked for design inspiration. Since I'm really into fitness, I decided to base my project on a real streetlifting event by FinalRep.</p>
				<p>The development process had its challenges, but compared to coming up with the concept, it went relatively smoothly. Working with vanilla CSS actually helped me revisit some forgotten concepts, like the mobile-first design approach. That really improved the responsiveness of our midterm project and also helped strengthen my CSS skills overall.</p>

				<p>Although this activity was assigned during class, I managed to complete it despite being absent that day when I somehow checked the canvas sometime after it was posted. The task involved coding 4 simple logic problems using JavaScript. While I encountered some challenges with syntax and logic errors, the overall process was relatively straightforward. This was largely because the concepts and techniques were similar to those found in other programming languages we've previously studied, making the activity familiar and easier to do.</p>
